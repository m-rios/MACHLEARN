\section{Introduction}
1) Title project (use a descriptive title so not e.g. Learning chess, but learning to play chess with neural networks and reinforcement learning).
2) Student member names with student numbers (3 or 4 members)
3) Application, explain how you get data or (implement) simulator, how many examples, what kind
of inputs, outputs, whether it is an RL, classification, or regression problem etc.
4) Methods. Explain the methods that you will compare. Identify the learning
algorithm and the optimization method.
5) Setup of Experiments
6) Chosen programming language
7) Planning. Describe the different phases and the planning deadlines (until the end of January).
