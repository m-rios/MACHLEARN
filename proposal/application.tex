We will train a computer to play chess end-games involving 4 or 6 chess pieces. 
 Several 'agents' will be
designed, each using a different machine learning technique. Then we will do the
following.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Train agents using a dataset.
    \item Train agents by having them play against each other.
\end{enumerate}
We will then do the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compare the rate of succes between data-learned agents. For this we will
find the correct evaluation metrics in literature.
\item Compare the rate of succes between play-trained agents. 
\item Compare the play-trained agents with data-trained agents.
We want to see if the play-trained agent is able to compete with the
data-trained
algorithm, and if it will surpass it in skill.
\item If time permits, we modify the data-trained agent to learn from 
games it plays while teaching the other algorithms.
\end{enumerate}
