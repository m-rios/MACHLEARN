        * algo by deepmind (nature cover)
            - general
            - same algo for different game
            - markov dic. process
            - action / value
            - nn takes pixels from game
            - state cnn
            - use very simple game (runner)
            - lib: openai 
                reinforced learning
                    - GENE (spelling?)
                    - python interface
            - investigate knowledge transfer
        * evolutionary ?
